## Kristopher Dabrowski's Blog

My name is Kristopher Dabrowski, I am learning how to code with my mentor [Alex Houchens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-houchens/). I live in Melbourne, Australia.

In my time working a Client Support role, I found that working on technical solutions was the most rewarding. I am learning how to code in Typescript on node js, since Typescript is a growing standard language with a lot of documentation and support, and node JS is a very simple runtime. I enjoy learning about functional programming concepts and principles to implement clean and clear code.

Since there's no replacement for practical hands-on experience, I've started to work on projects. My first completed project is the Orthodox Defender bot, which is a Discord Bot running live on the Orthodox Christian discord server, serving over 5000 members.

You can find my articles about writing this bot here: [>> Defender Project](defenderProject.md), posted on January 25, 2021
