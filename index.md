## Kristopher Dabrowski's Blog

My name is Kristopher Dabrowski, I am learning how to code with my mentor [Alex Houchens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-houchens/). I live in Melbourne, Australia. You can reach me at [krisdabrowski1992@gmail.com](krisdabrowski1992@gmail.com)

In my time working a Client Support role, I found that working on technical solutions was the most rewarding. I am learning how to code in Typescript on node js, since Typescript is a growing standard language with a lot of documentation and support, and node JS is a very simple runtime. I enjoy learning about functional programming concepts and principles to implement clean and clear code.

### Technical skills
- Typescript development
- MS Office and LibreOffice suite
- Adobe suite
- JIRA & Zendesk ticketing systems
- Over 100 WPM typing speed

### Future learning goals
- I am currently learning the [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, to produce web applications
- Learn more languages in the Javascript ecosystem, such as [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) or [Purescript](https://www.purescript.org/)
- Learn how to implement [webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) in projects, 

## Projects

Since there's no replacement for practical hands-on experience, I've started to work on projects. 

My first completed project is the Orthodox Defender bot, which is a Discord Bot running live on the Orthodox Christian discord server, serving over 5000 members.
