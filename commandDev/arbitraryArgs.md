# Arbitrary Argument Commmands

[<< Back to Project Overview](../defenderProject.md)

[< Back to Bot Commands](../botCommands.md)

In this post we'll cover two commands, `howmanyare` and `whois`. You may remember them from the [iterateOverMembersAndReturnData](../utilities/iterate.md) post. 

The purpose of `howmanyare` is to return a number of how many users have all of the roles given to the bot as arguments. The user types in `=howmanyare @Role1 @Role2 @Role3...` for as many roles as they wish to test, and the bot returns this number. 
 - For example, if there are 5 members with the role `@Lawyer`, telling the bot `=howmanyare @Lawyer` would return `Number of users with the following roles[@Lawyer] : 5`
 - If there are 4 members who had the role `@Doctor`, and 2 have the role `@Lawyer`, then typing `=howmanyare @Doctor @Lawyer` would return  `Number of users with the following roles[@Doctor, @Lawyer] : 2`
 
 The purpose of `whois` is similar to `howmanyare`, but instead of returning a raw number, the purpose is to return a list of usernames, their unique discriminator, and nickname.
  - For example, if there are 5 members with the role `@Lawyer`, telling the bot `=whois @Lawyer` would return `The users with the roles[@Lawyer] are: Jack#1234 (Blackjack), Jill#5656 (UpTheHill), Gary#6479 (GaryOaks), Tamara#9999 (T4m4r4), Clint#8887 (Westwood)`
 - If there are 4 members who had the role `@Doctor`, and 2 have the role `@Lawyer`, then typing `=howmanyare @Doctor @Lawyer` would return  `The users with the roles[@Doctor, @Lawyer] are : Jack#1234 (Blackjack), Jill#5656 (UpTheHill)`
 
First, we'll see `howmanyare`'s initial implementation. 
- The `!firstArgId` boilerplate is present, taken care of in [relevant post](bluh.md)
- The `updateArrayForHowManyAre` function is defined, and only used once, in the scope of this function. This pushes a user's name into the array, to be used as a token to track the amount of users who are in the array.
- `whohasRoles`, an empty array is initialised
- These newly declared variables are fed into the `iterateOverMembersAndReturnData` function, which was covered in [relevant post]
- The asynchronous `.then` block defines a callback function once `iterateOverMembersAndReturnData` has returned its values
  - The `returnedRoleArray` is given to the callback function as an input
  - The `message.channel.send` method sends a message to the channel that the user gave the bot a command in.
  - The roles, which are still in the `args` array, are joined to display them in this post
  - The length of `returnedRoleArray` is calculated, to display the number of users who have the associated roles
  
```typescript
case "howmanyare": //howmanyare @role @role .. etc
        if (!firstArgId) {
          return;
        }
        let updateArrayForHowManyAre = (
          inputMember: Discord.GuildMember,
          outputArray: string[]
        ): void => {
          outputArray.push(inputMember.user.username);
        };

        let whoHasRoles = [];

        iterateOverMembersAndReturnData(
          whoHasRoles,
          currentGuildObject,
          memberHasRolesFromArgs,
          updateArrayForHowManyAre
        ).then((returnedRoleArray) => {
          message.channel.send(
            `Number of users with the following roles[${args.join(", ")}] : ${
              returnedRoleArray.length
            }`
          );
        });
        break;
```

Far cleaner production release implementation of `howmanyare`:
-Three parameters are accepted
  1. The Discord server cache
  2. The IDs being tested on the users of this server
  3. The message that triggered this command
-The members are fetched asynchronously with `await inputGuildObject.members.fetch();`
-The empty array is typed and initialised
-The usernames of each user is pushed, simply as something to populate the array with
-The `roleNameArray` is defined, for posting the roles in the message
-The outputput message is sent

```typescript
export let howManyAreCommand = async (
inputGuildObject:Discord.Guild, 
inputIDs:string[], 
inputMessage:Discord.Message) => {

  let checkedMembers = await inputGuildObject.members.fetch();
  let usersWithRolesArray:string[] = []
  
  checkedMembers.forEach((member) => {
    if (memberHasAllRolesById(member, inputIDs)){
      usersWithRolesArray.push(member.user.username);
    }
  })
  let roleNameArray = returnRoleIdNameArrayToPost(inputIDs)
  
  inputMessage.channel.send(
    `Number of users with the following roles[${roleNameArray.join(", ")}] : ${usersWithRolesArray.length}`)
}
```

          inputMember: Discord.GuildMember,

          let nickname = inputMember.nickname

        };

        let returnUsers = [];

          let tooManyUsersToReturn = computedPost.length > 2000;
          if (!tooManyUsersToReturn) {

            let fileToAttach = new Discord.MessageAttachment("./whoIsFile.txt");
            message.channel.send(
              `Error! There are too many users that match your search! File has been generated with list of users.`,
              fileToAttach
            );
            // fs.unlinkSync('./whoIsFile.txt'); // File deletion not working - this just works though
