# Introduction

[<< Back to Project Overview](defenderProject.md)

The Orthodox Defender project is a bot for the Orthodox Christian discord server, currently serving nearly 5,000 members, to provide quality of life to Moderators & Administrators for repeated moderation actions. 

This is my first completed project in Typescript, implementing the `discord.js` library to code the bot, using node.js to deploy the bot, and Google cloud to host the virtual machine that the bot's node.js instance runs on. I've learned a lot during this project, and so this series of articles reviews the initial commit I made to github, and the development process & architectural decisions made to reach the production build of the bot. 

In the next article, I discuss the project's imports, dependencies and folder structure.
