# Introduction

[<< Back to Project Overview](defenderProject.md)

The Orthodox Defender project is a bot for the Orthodox Christian discord server, currently serving nearly 5,000 members, to provide quality of life to Moderators & Administrators for repeated moderation actions. 

This is my first completed project in Typescript: 
- Implementing the `discord.js` library to code the bot 
- Deployed with `node.js`
- Hosted on a Google cloud virtual machine

This series of articles reviews the progress & design choices I made from the initial commit to github, to the production build of the bot. 

In the next article, I discuss the project's imports, dependencies and folder structure.
