# Genesis of Code

## Code that depends on nothing

Everything we code has dependencies. We depend on the libraries of code we reference. Those libraries depend on their authors. Those authors in turn depend on the programming language the libraries are written in, which are written by the language's authors.

There are three types of dependency: Time, Space, Matter.
However, what are the dependencies of time, space and matter?

The second law of thermodynamics proves that matter must have a dependency - if it had no dependency and was eternal, then we would have reached the heat death already, infinite time already passing.

What are the raw dependencies, on which cannot depend on anything else? This dependency must not be bound by time, since time depends on it - since every moment in time depends on the previous moment.. This dependency must not be bound by space - since every point of space(if space even has points). This dependency must not be bound by matter.

These three are co-dependant, and each one cannot have been a result of themselves, and none of them can have been the sole or joint cause of the other.

What does the documentation for the creation of the cosmos say?

*In the Beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth.*

The programmers of the cosmos we live in, the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit simultaneously created the co-dependant realities of Time(*In the Beginning*), Space(*Heavens*) and Matter(*Earth*).

## Design from a designer, or design from nothing?

## Intelligent design, or blind evolution?
