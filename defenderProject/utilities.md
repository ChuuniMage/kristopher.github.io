# Utilities

[<< Back to Project Overview](defenderIndex.md)

[< Initialisation & Message Initialisation](initialisationAndOnMessage.md)

The following three posts cover the utility functions. The purpose of these functions is to declutter the main index file by abstract repetitive code and technical code.

The following three files contain the utility functions:

- `chanUtils.ts`, contains utilities for interacting with message channels
- `argUtils.ts`, contains utilities for parsing arguments
- `roleUtils.ts`, contains utilities for interacting with user roles

First, we'll look at the channel utilities.
