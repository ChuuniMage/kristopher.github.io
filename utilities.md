# Utilities

The following three posts cover the utility function files. The purpose of these utility files is to declutter the main index file of the program, and abstract repetitive code into functions that are easy to call. 

We have the following three utilities files:
- `argUtils.ts`, the utilities for parsing arguments
- `roleUtils.ts`, the utilities for interacting with user roles
- `chanUtils.ts`, the utilities for interacting with message channels

First, we'll look at the argument utilities.
